Coding Challenge: Customer Support Ticket System
Challenge Overview
In this challenge, you'll create an interactive Customer Support Ticket System for managing support requests in a company.

This challenge reinforces selecting nodes, using createElement, appendChild, removeChild, and handling event propagation with stopPropagation(). The business case simulates real-world scenarios where a company needs to efficiently track and manage customer support inquiries.
